shell->cmdline is filled with cmd line using readline

1) Lexer

- insert_spaces: insert spaces between the tokens (echo>infile becomes echo > infile)

- insert_spaces_quotes(t_mini *shell): insert space after even insert_spaces_quotes

- count_tokens: counts the nb of tokens

- init_lex: will init struct t_lex :

typedef struct s_lex
{
	int				i;
	int				nb_expansions;
	char			*word;
	t_token			token;
	struct s_lex	*next;
}	t_lex;
malloc the linked list thanks to nb_token & initiates the elements of the struct

- assign_word(shell): fills word in lex structure.
  with get_token : big malloc with size of cmdline + 1 for each token. Fills with the token, spliting with spaces.
  Special function to handle spaces between double quote: they should not generate a new token.


- assign_token : if it is | token pipe, same for < << > >>, if not token WORD.
